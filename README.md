### Hi there 👋

- 🧑‍💻 I'm a fullstack developer working with a variety of programming languages and technologies. Favorites are Solidity, Rust and Python
- 🫶 I’m looking to collaborate on anything interesting but ideally should be a useful product
- 💬 You can talk to me about (anything really, but mostly) films, literature, history, philosophy, coding



- `while true {read; watchMovie; code;}`
