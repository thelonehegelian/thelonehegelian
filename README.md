### Hi there 👋

- 🧑‍💻 I'm a fullstack developer working with a variety of programming languages and technologies. Favorites are Solidity, Rust and Python
- 🔭 I’m currently working on a few projects in different languages: a compiler, an OS from scratch, an ML app and a web3 app 
- 🌱 I'm always learning something, but these days I am learning about operating systems, compilers and zero-knowledge proofs
- 🫶 I’m looking to collaborate on anything interesting but ideally should be a useful product
- 💬 You can talk to me about (anything really) but mostly films, literature, history, philosophy, coding
- 👨🏻‍🎓 Encode Club Expert Solidity and ZK Bootcamp alumnus
